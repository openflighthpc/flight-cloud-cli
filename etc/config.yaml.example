# CA_PATH - REQUIRED
# Setup the certificate authority used by HTTPS/SSL. The location of the SSL
# certificates depends on the system configuration. See the following link for
# further details or contact your system administrator
# https://github.com/lostisland/faraday/wiki/Setting-up-SSL-certificates
#
# NOTE: The SSL verification can be turned off by setting the value to 'false'
# (without quotes). This is not recommended as it opens up multiple types of
# cryptographic attacks. However this can sometimes be useful when using a self
# signed certificate.
